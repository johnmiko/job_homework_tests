# Acceptance Criteria

Renamed power-calc to power_calc so I could import functions from it
Change data type of sets to tuples

#-------------
# 1.) Program can accept a json file (ie. data1.json) from the command line.
# 2.) Program can verify that json file exists and is in expected format.
# 3.) Program can clean json file:
#   a) ensure it is semantically correct and have known quantities for voltage, current, and power factor.
#   b) Use allowable names (V_NAMES, I_NAMES, PF_NAMES) provided below to clean keys.
# 4.) Program creates a new dictionary that has the same location as the primary key, but the value is three new
#       calculated quantities:
#           s = apparent power
#           p = real power
#           q = reactive power
# 5.) Use the "calc_power" function to handle the calculations for the new dictionary.
#   Note: Some of the input data doesnâ€™t include power factor. In those cases, please assume a power factor of 0.9.
# 6.) Complete the TODO in calc_power. Use the calc_power doc string for more information.
# 7.) Program outputs the n ew dictionary in a user readable manner.
