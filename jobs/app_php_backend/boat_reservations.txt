Boat reservation system

1 single business
1000 Boats, they are all the same, a number written on the side of each boat
1 person manning the phone at the same time
A boat can be reserved for 1 or more days

We need to support the following operations:

Do you have a boat available between date A and B -> yes/no
Give their name, phone # and dates A - B -> res # / no
Give their name, phone #, ask for their reservation numbers -> res # s
Cancel res # -> ok

“””
Make relational schema - just tables and fields
After write queries
Boat has ID as = boat_number
Reservation_time = 1 or more days, increment by number of days
always come back in time, boats never break
Boat available for time period? Always has to be the same boat
IF reservation, record name, phone # + dates, if yes, respond yes/no
Need to be able to tell them all the reservations they have
Cancel reservation

boat , id, person has it, time
No time limits
“””
schema
Boats, days unavailable
people , name, phone


Table Boat,
Id = UUID

Table Reservations
ID = UUID = primary key
Boat_id = ID
Person = string
Contact Info = string = phone number
Start date = datefield
End date = datefield

Do you have a boat available between date A and B -> yes/no
2 scenarios in which a boat is available
Boat id does not exist in reservation table
Boat id exists in reservation table, but is not reserved in the requested time period
Query the reservations table
	Wanted_start
	wanted_end

SELECT * FROM Boat
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT boat_id FROM Reservations
WHERE boat.id=reservations.boat_id)

	// Need to catch the case where the boat can have more than 1 reservation.
// For each boat, select all reservations, check if it is not free
	// the boat is not free if the wanted_start exists between any dates

OR
wanted_start < start_date AND wanted_end < end_date  // before current reservation
wanted_start > start_date  AND wanted_end  > end_date  // after existing reservation

AND wanted_end not between start_date AND end_date


User requests boat from May 5th to 10th, is there a boat available?
Any boats with 0 reservations? Yes no, if no go to next step
Any boats with reservations, but not from May 5th to 10th
Lets say boat 4 is booked from May 1st to May 7th
Boat 6 is booked for April 20th to 30th AND June 1st to 10th
What query will return boat 7 as available

// Possible scenarios
Is the wanted_start > start_date and wanted_start < end_date // unavailable
Is the wanted_end > start_date and wanted_end < end_date // unavailable

Is the wanted_start < start_date and wanted_start < end_date // maybe available
Is the wanted_end < start_date and wanted_end < end_date // maybe available

// boat is only available if the previous 2 conditions are both true for all
(wanted_start < start_date and wanted_start < end_date) AND
(wanted_end < start_date and wanted_end < end_date)



If there is any boats not in the reservation table, then we know, that that boat is available

Date range

Give their name, phone # and dates A - B -> res # / no
Give their name, phone #, ask for their reservation numbers -> res # s
Cancel res # -> ok
