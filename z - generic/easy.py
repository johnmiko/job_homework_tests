# Question: How do you do dictionary comprehension?
# """
# Answer
# # dict2 = {k.upper(): v for k, v in dict.items()}
#
# Given this list, how would you get the last 2 elements
# A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# b = A[-2:]
# How do you change the increment from say 1 to 2
# b = A[start:stop:step]
# How would you reverse the list?
# b = A[::-1]
